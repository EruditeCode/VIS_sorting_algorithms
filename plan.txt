Plan - Visualisation Tool for Sorting Algorithms

DESIGN LOGIC:
Rather than generating each list of numbers for the stage of the sort in situ, the program will complete the entire sort, storing the stages in a large array. This array will be the frames that will then be viewed in the display.

INTERFACE AESTHETICS:
A menu bar (plain background) at the left hand side.
A display area (space background) to the right hand side.
Menu:
1. Title Section at the top.
2. Three buttons to select the sort.
3. A slider to select the number of elements to be sorted (50-500).
4. A slider to select the range of numbers (1-100) with two circles to represent the upper and lower bound.
5. A play/pause button.
6. A reset button.
Display:
1. White rectangles to represent the numbers being sorted.
2. A space background.

PROGRAM ARCHITECTURE:
1. main.py - handles the main logic of the program and visualisation, is the executable.
2. sort_modules.py - handles the sort logic and returns the array of frames.
3. ui_modules.py - handles aspects to do with user interface e.g. is the mouse over a button or not.
